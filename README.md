# Itinerant Tester

Create a [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file for running [eslint](https://eslint.org) tests on the [GitHub Trending JavaScript](https://github.com/trending?l=javascript) repos.

What about a different approach?  What if I hava a JavaScript Python command line app that accepts the name of a repo or repos and commits a new .travis.yml file to this repo that contains the command line repos.  That commit will cause this repo to run tests on the command line repos.
